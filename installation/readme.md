# Getting started with SQL 2019 big data cluster in Azure

## What is SQL 2019 big data cluster?

SQL Server 2019 is in preview and will include Apache spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 
This new architecture of SQL 2019 that combines structured and unstructured data processing engines is called a big data cluster. 
You will find more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview?view=sqlallproducts-allversions).

## Sign up for SQL 2019 big data cluster

Currently, to gain access to the images that form the crux of the SQL 2019 big data cluster, the customer will need to signing up [here](https://sqlservervnexteap.azurewebsites.net/). 
Once the SQL team approves your request, you will receive a user name and password that will provide access to the containers.

## Setting up a client machine in Azure to access the big data cluster

Go to the azure portal and create a VM with Windows operating. I use a Windows 10 pro, version 1803 to build my client VM in azure.
